//! A custom [Rerun](https://rerun.io) viewer for ROS 2 visualization, built on Rerun v0.38.
//!
//! Rewire Viewer extends the Rerun native viewer with ROS 2-specific panels (Topics, Nodes,
//! Diagnostics) and a status bar showing relay connectivity. It is a pure client: it dials a
//! relay (`rewire serve`) or any Rerun gRPC endpoint for data and auto-reconnects with backoff.
//!
//! Supports both native (desktop) and WebAssembly builds.

/// Wrapper around [`re_viewer::App`] that adds the Rewire status bar.
